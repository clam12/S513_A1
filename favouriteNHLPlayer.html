			<h2>Peter Forsberg</h2>
			<h3>About Him</h2>
			
			<p class="info">Peter Mattias Forsberg, born on July 20th, 1973 in Ornskoldsvik, 
			Sweden. Before getting drafted into the NHL, Forsberg played his junior hockey 
			for his hometown team of Modo. On June 22nd, 1991 in Buffalo, New York, Forsberg 
			was drafted 6th overall by the Philadelphia Flyer however, before ever suiting 
			for the Philadelphia Flyers as a rookie, he was traded to the Quebec Nordiques 
			in 1992 (before they relocated to Colorado) where he would go on play for the club 
			for a total of 11 of his 13 NHL seasons. Although his career was hit by injury, Forsberg 
			went on to have a terrific career playing over 700 games and totaling 885 goals in his 
			NHL career. Forsberg would retire from hockey on February 14, 2011 and would later 
			have his jersey retired by the Colorado Avalanche on October 8, 2011.</p>
			
			<h3>Why He's My Favourite</h3>
			<p class="reason">I started watching hockey at a young age mostly because my dad 
			was also a big hockey fan. Although I was a Flames fan as a kid, I had always admired 
			the way Forsberg played. He had great mix of skill and physicality and whenever you 
			saw him play, you could only marvel at his talent. As I got older, Forsberg grew on 
			me more and more and I just loved watching him play. It was unfortunate that his NHL 
			career was cut short because of injury.</p>
