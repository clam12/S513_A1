			<h2>Who I am?</h2>

			<p class="opening1">My name is Chris Lam and I am a big sports fan. 
				I watch all kind of sports from basketball to hockey to baseball
				and I thought what better time to share who my favourite athletes 
				are than now. In North America, there are 4 major sports leagues 
				and these sports include: </p>
				
			<ul>
				<li>Major League Baseball(MLB)</li>
				<li>National Hockey League (NHL)</li>
				<li>National Football League (NFL)</li>
				<li>National Basketball Assoication (NBA)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="opening2">I will introduce 3 of my favourite players from 3 of 
			the 4 leagues. I will provide a little bit of information on each as well 
			as provide a table of their stats in the major leagues. Of course I won't 
			say who they are here. If you want to see who they are, you have to click 
			on each individual link :).</p>
