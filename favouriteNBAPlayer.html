			<h2>Tim Duncan</h2>
			<h3>About Him</h3>
			
			<p class="info">Timothy Theodore Duncan, born on April 25, 1976 in Christiansted, U.S. 
			Virgin Islands. Duncan would play his college basketball at Wake Forest and upon graduating, 
			he would enter the NBA Draft in 1997. On June 25, 1997, Duncan would be drafted 1st overall by the 
			San Antonio Spurs where he would play his entire legendary career at for 19 seasons. It 
			can be argued that Duncan is one of the greatest power forwards to play the game of basketball. 
			Throughout his lusterous career, Duncan would total over 25,000 points, 15,000 rebounds and 
			4,000 assists and would go on to win 5 NBA Championships, all with the San Antonio Spurs. 
			On July 11, 2016, Duncan would announce his retirement from the NBA and would later have 
			his jersey retired by the Spurs on December 18, 2016.</p>
			
			<h3>Why He's My Favourite</h3>
			<p class="reason">Just like hockey, I've been watching basketball for a long time but not as long 
			as I have watched hockey. With Duncan, its not so much as his on court play which I admire most 
			about him but its more so with his off court persona. When you hear other players and coaches talk 
			about Duncan, they never have anything bad to say about him. He has also done a lot for the community of 
			San Antonio from establishingthe Tim Duncan Foundation which serves the areas of health awareness, 
			educataion and youth sports to also supporting Children's Bereavement Center, Children Center's of 
			San Antonio and the CancerTherapy and Research Center. Also, three of the most important values to Duncan 
			I find very inspiring. These three values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.</p>
			<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>5x NBA Champion</li>
				<li>3x NBA Finals MVP</li>
				<li>2x NBA MVP</li>
				<li>15x NBA All Star</li>
				<li>NBA Rookie of the Year</li>
				<li>No. 21 Jersey Retired by the San Antonio Spurs</li>
