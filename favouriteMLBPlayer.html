			<h2>Matt Carpenter</h2>
			<h3>About Him</h3>
			
			<p class="info">Matthew Martin Lee Carpenter, born on November 26, 1985 in Galveston, Texas. 
			Carpenter played his junior baseball at Texas Christian University and in 2009, Carpenter was 
			drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 13th round, 399th overall. It wasn't until 2011 when 
			Carpenter made his major league debut and 2012 where he earned a starting spot on their roster. 
			He is still an active player, having played 6 seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals. Through his 
			career so far, he has been named a 3x all star becuase the first second basemen in Cardinals history 
			to win the Silver Slugger Award his is awarded to the best offensive player that season at each position.</p>
			
			<h3>Why He's My Favourite</h3>
			<p class="reason">Unlike hockey and basketball, I hadn't started watching baseball till recently however, 
			baseball is just one of those sports that I wish I would have gotten to play growing up as a kid. The main 
			reason why Matt Carpenter is my favourite is because he's one of those players that show you that you don't 
			have to be a high picked player to be a great player and with reference to baseball, you don't have to power 
			to help your team. Carpenter isn't a home run machine like some other players but instead, plays more for contact 
			and is able to hit the ball in way where he can get on base and allow his team to score which is evident in 
			Carpenter being a 2x NL doubles leader in 2013 and 2015.</p>
